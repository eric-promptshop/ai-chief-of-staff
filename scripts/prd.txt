# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Chief of Staff

## 📘 Overview
**Project Name:** AI Chief of Staff  
**Version:** MVP v1.0  
**Owner:** Optimind AI  
**Status:** In Development  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-29

## 🎯 Purpose
To design an intelligent AI-first orchestration layer that manages a digital workforce of agents. This Chief of Staff will enable users to delegate tasks, configure agent autonomy, and oversee execution using explainable, secure, and context-aware AI interactions.

This PRD is fully compatible with **Task-Master** framework standards for modular, agent-based projects.

---

## ✅ Goals
- Enable users to delegate tasks via natural language.
- Dynamically configure and assign agents using Microsoft AutoGen.
- Log task completions and agent decisions using Supabase.
- Support multi-agent chat threads and explainability.
- Design a modular UI with Vercel-deployed frontend.

## 🔍 User Stories
1. **As a Founder**, I want to delegate a task to my AI team by typing a command.
2. **As an Operator**, I want to view what each agent is working on.
3. **As an Analyst**, I want to upload company documents and use them to train writing agents.
4. **As a Team Lead**, I want to monitor execution logs and view agent autonomy levels.
5. **As an Admin**, I want to manually override agent assignments.
